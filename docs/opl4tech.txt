  MoonSound technical documentation
===============================================================================

This document describes the MoonSound and especially the main component, the
Yamaha OPL4 chip. It is a copy of the official documentation from Yamaha with
some additional notes made by me where I thought that the original descriptions
were not very clear. Note that this document does not describe the FM (OPL3)
part of the OPL4. You can find that information in a seperate text file. All
diagrams are drawn with ASCII characters to enable easy viewing and printing
of this document on MSX as well as on PC.

Included with this document are three small GIF files. These are scans of some
pictures in the original document. Two more GIFs of the hardware pin assignment
are also available but not included here because of their size and their very
limited use for the average programmer.

I would like to thank Marcel Delorme for typing and scanning most of the
original document.

I replaced the three scans with a single GIF file that contains all the
envelope diagrams. The image quality is better and it takes less disk space.

  MoonSound description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MoonSound cartridge has 3 important components:
- The OPL4 (YMF278B).
- The Yamaha YRW801 2MB ROM with samples for the OPL4.
- 128K SRAM to enable you to use your own samples.

The I/O of the OPL4 can be done on the following I/O ports:

07Eh wave register
07Fh wave data
0C4h FM bank 1 register
0C5h FM data
0C6h FM bank 2 register

0C7h is a mirror of the FM data register but use of 0C5h is preferred.

The status register is also located at 0C4h at all times.

The OPL4 is 100% compatible with the OPL3 which is described in a seperate
document and meets the OPL(tm) standard. OPL(tm) is a trademark of Yamaha
Corporation which represents a full register compatibility with Yamaha YMF3812
(OPL2).

Important: To enable access to the Wave registers and the extra bit in the
status register, you have to set bit D0 and D1 in register 5 of FM bank 2.
In basic this would look like this:
OUT &HC6,5
OUT &HC5,&B11

There is no documentation available about the contents of the ROM chip. If you
want to use these for (e.g. your own music editor or replayer) you can contact
me and I can give you some of the info I found in the two weeks of long hard and
boring work I spent on it.

     YAC513.

  2. YMF278 can be connected to the YSS225(EP) witch gives various effects 
     to sound data.

  3. YMF278 can read all registers.

  4. Pack contains 80-pin QFP.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CPU INTERFACE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sound generation control for the YMF278 is performed by writing data into 
registers. An 8-bit parallel CPU interface is provided to write data into
and read status form each register. D0-D7 are bi-directional data buses, and 
/CS,/RD,/WR,/WR,A0,A1,A2 are data bus control signal input.
The data buses are set as shown below by the data control signal:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|     | /CS | /RD | /WR | /A0 | /A1 | /A2 |          MODE           |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------------------------+
|     |  H  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |    Inactive mode        |
|     |  L  |  L  |  H  |  L  |  L  |  L  |    Status read mode     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------------------------+
|     |  L  |  H  |  L  |  L  | L/H |  L  |    Address write mode   |
| FM  |  L  |  H  |  L  |  H  |  X  |  L  |    Data write mode      |
|     |  L  |  L  |  H  |  H  |  X  |  L  |    Data read mode       |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------------------------+
|     |  L  |  H  |  L  |  L  |  L  |  H  |    Address write mode   |
| PCM |  L  |  H  |  L  |  H  |  L  |  H  |    Data wrtie mode      |
|     |  L  |  L  |  H  |  H  |  L  |  H  |    Data read mode       |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------------------------+
                                                X: Don't Care

 (a)  Inactive Mode
     
      Data buses D0-D7 are set to high impedance when /CS is H

 (b)  Address Write Mode
    
      This mode specifies the write address. Output the address data of the 
      register to be written to the data bus. Then, setting data is written
      in data write mode. However, a wait period of 17 cycles of the master
      clock is required during this period. To specify register array 0 with
      FM, set A1 = L. To use register array 1, set A1 = H.

 (c)  Data Write Mode

      This mode writes data at the address which is set in address write mode
      immediately before. Output setting data to the datat bus. A wait period
      of 56 master-clock cycles is required for FM, and a wait period of 88
      master-clock cycles is required for PCM until the next address write or
      data write.

 (d)  Data Read Mode

      This mode reads data at the address which is set in address write mode
      immediately before.

 (e)  Status Read Mode

      This mode outputs the status of the YMF278 to the data bus.

Notes) 1. Be sure to set unused bits and TEST registers to 0.
       2. Mix control registers (FM-R, FM-L) of F8h are set to 3 (-9dB), other
          registers are set to '0' by initial clear.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 REGISTERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the (OPL4), a sound which is output is called a channel. In the PCM
synthesizer unit, 1-24 channels can be output simultaneosly. 08H-F7H of 
registers are grouped into 24-byte units, and each group corresponds to 1-24 
channels sequentially.

+ 00H-01H TEST
  
  This register is used for testing LSI. set
  this registers to "0" for normal use.

                               +-----+-----------------------------+----+----+

  Important: When you are using the MoonSound, always select the ROM mode. Even
  if you are using SRAM and ROM!!


+ 02H TONE HEADER

  This register sets the range of setting in every 512K byte unit for the
  128-tone header (no.384-no.511 out of 512 tones)

                               +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  If D2-D4 = 0, set headers    |     | D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 |
  for 512 tones starting with  | 02H +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  addres 0 in the external     |     |              | Tone header  |         |
  memory.                      +-----+--------------+--------------+---------+

  In the MoonSound the last 128 headers will be located after the 2MB ROM.
  Since this is 4*512, the tone header value must be 4 (100b).


+ 02H DEVICE ID

                               +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  Used for ID register, no     |     | D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 |

  available.                   |     |   DevicdID   |                        |
                               +-----+--------------+------------------------+

  This is probably used to identify what kind of chip you are using. My guess
  is that it will have the following values:
  0 = not used
  1 = OPL4
  2 = future OPL5?


+ 03H-5H MEMORY ADDRESS REGISTER

  These registers set the ex-  +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

                               +-----+---------------------------------------+

  Addresses are automatically  +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  incremented by data write or |     | D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 |

                               +-----+---------+-----------------------------+
  A wait period of 28 master-clock cycles
  is required until the next data write.

  By reading this register, the data at the external memory address which is
  currently set can be read.

  A wait period of 38 master-clock cycles is required until the next data
  read.


+ 08H-1FH TONE NUMBER

  The OPL4 supports a maximum of 512 tones. Select the
  number of the tone to be     +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  produced from 512 tones, and |     | D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 |
  set the selected number in   | 08- +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  the tone number register     | 1FH |              Tone number              |
  of the channel from which    +-----+---------------------------------------+
  tone is to be produced.
  The tone header is then internally loaded automaticlly.

  The loading time is approxi- +-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

  in the register. Do not      | 37H |                                  |no8.|
  access the tone number, LFO, +-----+----------------------------------+----+
  V1B,AR,D1R,DL,D2R, rate
  compensation, RR and AM register of the channel during loading.
  However, access can be made to other register even when the tone header is
  being loaded.

  The flag which indicates loading is located at bit D1 of the status
  register.

  Always set the tone numbers (7-0) after the tone number (8) because tone
  number setting completes by the setting of the tone numbers (7-0).

  setting of F-NUM (f6-f0).    |     | D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 |
                               | 38- +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  If F-NUM is 0 and octave is  | 4FH |       Octave      |                   |
  1, waveform data will be     +-----+-------------------+-------------------+
  regenerated in sequence at
  44.1 Khz. This is used as the reference (F(c) = 0).

  The formula to obtain the pitch variation for the reference is as follows:

  F (c) = 1200 * (octave-1) + 1200 * log2 [(1024 + F-NUM) /1024 ]

                              Where 1 octave = 1200 c

  +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

  See the OPL3 document for more info on IRQ, FT1 and FT2.

  BUSY: The BUSY flag is valid while NEW2=1. This flag becomes 1 while writing
        address and data. BUSY flag automatically returns to 0 when writing is
        completed.

  LD  : Indicates that a Wave Table header is loaded. Returns to 0 when loading
        is completed. See reg. 8 for more info.

Although there is no info in the manual about this I think that the BUSY flag
is not only for writing, but also for reading. It works for FM, Wave and Wave
data transfer! On the Z80A waiting for the BUSY flag is never neccessary, but
on the 7Mhz Z80 or the R800 it is neccessary. Not always, but on unpredictable
moments so it MUST be used if you are making something and you are planning to
use it for R800 or 7Mhz. The disadvantage for Z80 is that it takes some time
to check this every time and the Z80 needs all the speed it can get.

  ENVELOPES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Envelope Graphs

  The envelopes are shown in the GIF file.
  To produce continuous sound, set D2R = 0 (RATE = 0, real time = inf).

+ Pseudoreverb effect

  When the pseudoreverb in 38H-4FH is set to "1", pseudoreverb effect can be
  applied. The envelope when pseudoreverb effect is applied is shown in the
  GIF file. When the envelope decreases below -18 dB, D1R, D2R and RR are
  disregarded,and RevR (fixed at 5) is set. Pseudoreverb can also be applied
  to continuous at below -18 dB in the same manner.
