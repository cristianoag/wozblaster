## Content of this folder:

* [27C160 Adapter](/hardware/27c160-tl866-adapter) - This folder contains the files necessary to build an adapter that allows you to program the 27C160 EPROM on inexpensive TL866 programmers.
* [GAL16V8 JEDEC](/hardware/gal16v8d) - This folder contains the fuse file required to program the GAL16V8 SPLD with the selection circuit needed for the Wozblasters.
* [YRW801-M ROM] - This folder contains the binary content needed to program flash or EPROMs with the contents of the YRW801-M (MIDI Samples).
* [Wozblaster v1](hardware/v1) - This folder contains the original Wozblaster board created by Gustavo Iriarte. (Released)
* [Wozblaster Reloaded v1.1](/hardware/reloaded_v1.1) - Based on the original circuit, this version features a combination of through-hole and surface-mount components. The board is smaller and can fit in both Konami and Patola cases. (Released)
* [Wozblaster Reloaded v1.2](/hardware/reloaded_v1.2) - This version replaces the old 27C160 EPROM with an AM29F016B flash, and all passive components are 0603 SMD. The sound is injected back to SOUNDIN in mono. The board is smaller and can fit in both Konami and Patola cases. (In development)
* [Wozblaster Reloaded v2.0](/hardware/reloaded_v2) - This version features an AM29F016B flash in place of the 27C160 EPROM, all passive components are 0603 SMD, and the YAC513 DAC is replaced by a NEC UPD6376. The sound is injected back to SOUNDIN in mono, and the LF347 OP Amps are replaced with 4558s. The audio circuit has been improved, and the board is smaller and can fit in both Konami and Patola cases. (In development)
