## CPLD Code

The Wozblaster Reloaded 5.0 uses a EPM7064STC44 CPLD. The code is available in the `cpld` folder. The code was written in Verilog and compiled using the Quartus II software. The compiled file `msx_opl4.pof` is also available in the `cpld` folder.

It implements the selection of the OPL4 chip and its registers. 

The I/O of the OPL4 can be done on the following I/O ports:

|Port|Binary|Function|
|-----|---------|----|
|07Eh |01111110 | wave register	|
|07Fh |01111111 | wave data|				
|0C4h |11000100 | FM bank 1 register|
|0C5h |11000101 | FM data|
|0C6h |11000110 | FM bank 2 register|


0C7h is a mirror of the FM data register but use of 0C5h is preferred.

The selection of the EPM7064STC44 CPLD was due to the fact that it is a common CPLD supporting 5V and can be found in several sources. It is also less subject to JTAG locking than other versions of the EPM7064 based on PLCC. The 
EPM7032STC44 can also be used as it is pin compatible with the EPM7064STC44 and the size of the code is small enough to fit in the EPM7032STC44.

## SOUNDIN

The SOUNDIN signal for the MSX computer is obtained by combining the two stereo channels into a single mono channel over the LM358 operational amplifier. The LM358 is powered by 5V and the output is connected to the SOUNDIN signal of the MSX computer.
